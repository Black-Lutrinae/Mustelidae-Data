## Credentials

To generate credentials, you go to the admins sdk [page](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/mustelidae-data/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk), and click in "generate new private key". Then you will download a `.json` file, which you will save as `db-credentials.json` in the root of this project.
